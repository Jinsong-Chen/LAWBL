\title{LAWBL: Latent (Variable) Analysis with Bayesian Learning}
\description{
This package is to provide a variety of models to analyze latent variables based on Bayesian learning.
}
\details{
\emph{LAWBL} represents a partially confirmatory / exploratory approach to model latent variables based on Bayesian learning.
Built on the power of statistical learning, it can address psychometric challenges such as parameter specification, local dependence,
and factor extraction. Built on the scalability and flexibility of Bayesian inference and resampling techniques, it can accommodate
modeling frameworks such as factor analysis, item response theory, cognitive diagnosis modeling and causal or explanatory modeling.
The package can also handle different response formats or a mix of them, with or without missingness. The variety of models provide
a partial approach covering a wide range of the exploratory-confirmatory continuum under the context of latent variable modeling.

Towards the confirmatory end, this package includes the Partially Confirmatory Factor Analysis (PCFA) model for continuous data
(Chen, Guo, Zhang, & Pan, 2020), the generalized PCFA (GPCFA) model covering continuous, categorical, and mixed-type data,
and the partially confirmatory item response model (PCIRM) for continuous and dichotomous data with intercept terms (Chen, 2020).
For PCFA, GPCFA, and PCIRM, there are two major model variants with different constraints for identification. One assumes local
independence (LI) with a more exploratory tendency, which can be also called the E-step. The other allows local dependence (LD)
with a more confirmatory tendency, which can be also called the C-step.

Towards the exploratory end, the Bayesian regularized EFA (BREFA) with factor extraction and parameter estimation in one step (Chen 2021)
is offered. It's further improved as the Fully and partially EFA with better performance and partial knowledge.

Parameters are obtained by sampling from the posterior distributions with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Different
Bayesian learning methods are used to regularize the loading pattern, local dependence, and/or factor identification.
